# Tour Fleet Management System for Skyline Tours

This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive Tour Fleet Management System, developed as a final year project for the Bachelor of Information Technology degree at the University of Colombo School of Computing. The system is designed to digitize and streamline the core operations of a tour bus rental company.


## üö© The Problem
Skyline Tours, a tour bus rental company, was managing its entire operation using a manual, paper-based system. This led to significant business challenges, including:

- **Frequent Booking Overlaps:** Poor planning and lack of a central system caused double bookings and scheduling conflicts.
- **Inaccurate Financial Tracking:** Manual ledgers made it difficult to track payments, manage expenses, and identify potential financial losses.
- **Poor Inventory Management:** Inefficient tracking of spare parts resulted in stock imbalances and unexpected shortages.
- **Operational Disruptions:** Missed vehicle service schedules led to preventable, mid-tour breakdowns, impacting customer satisfaction and company reputation.

This project was motivated by the need to solve these critical issues by developing a centralized, reliable, and efficient software solution.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   A local server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or WAMP.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Pooraka/TourFleetManagement.git
    ```
2.  **Move to your server directory:**
    -   Place the cloned folder into the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.

3.  **Set up the Database:**
    -   Open `phpMyAdmin` (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    -   Create a new database and name it `tour_fleet_management_system_db`.
    -   Select the new database and go to the `Import` tab.
    -   Upload the `tour_fleet_management_system_db.sql` file (this file is inside the 'dbbackup' folder) and click `Go`.

4.  **Configure the Application:**
    -   Navigate to the database connection file in the project (e.g., `/config/database.php`).
    -   Ensure the database name, username (usually `root`), and password (usually empty) match your local setup.
